Transverse momentum analysis of 
   - charged  lepton
   - vector  sum  of  b  and  bbar
   - vector  sum  of  jet’s  quarks
   - vector  sum  of  WW  components  (without  neutrino)
   
Transverse  energy  analysis of 
  - charged  lepton
  - vector sum  of  b  and  bbar
  - vector sum  of  jet’s  quarks
 
Other variables: 
 - scalar  sum  of  all  transverse  momenta  (Ht)
 - scalar  sum  of  all  transverse  momenta  without  neutrino
 - transverse  missing  momentum
 
 Merit factors:
- Product between significance level ( S_sx) and power (B_dx) that must be minimized
- Fattore di merito S_sx/sqrt(B_sx)
- Signal purity: purity = (1-S_sx)*N_s / ( (1-S_sx)*N_s + B_dx*N_b )
Note: S_sx cdf_signal(0,x)
      B_dx cdf_background(inf, x)
      
Lep_pt, Ptm, bb_pt or bb_et show the more different distributions we may proceed to a toy MC simulation.
