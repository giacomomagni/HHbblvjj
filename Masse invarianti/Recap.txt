The following invarian masses are analyzed:

 - Mbb
 
 - Mjj
 
 - Mww (without the neutrino)

Some cuts on the background are applied: 
  -- 120 < Mbb < 130 GeV/c^2
  -- Mww < 125       GeV/c^2
The events are separated in two categories:
  -- Mjj > 50        GeV/c^2
  -- Mjj < 50        GeV/c^2    there is no Background (they won't be considered in this analysis anymore)

This choice select around:
   50% of the signal events (only the 3rd is effective on the signal) 
   3% of the background events (only the the two cuts are effective) 
       
NOTE: 
if Mjj < 50 GeV/c^2 there is no Background, in ttbar no W are created OffShell.
