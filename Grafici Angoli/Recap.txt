R and Phi angles analyzed:

  - delta b_bbar: the two particles are boosted in the same direction. Peak at 2*Mh/<pT>
  
  - delta lep_jj: the particles are highly boosted in the same dicerction 
  
  - delta bbar_lepjj:  HH are created mostly back to back.   
  
Two cuts may be proposed: 
  - deltaR bbar_lepjj > 2.85
  - deltaR lep_jj < 0.9
