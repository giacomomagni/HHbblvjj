R and Phi angles analyzed:

  - delta b_bbar: the two particles are boosted in the same direction. Peak at 2*Mh/<pT>
  
  - delta lep_jj: the particles are highly boosted in the same dicerction 
  
  - delta bbar_lepjj:  HH are created mostly back to back.   
  
 Merit factors:
- Product between significance level ( S_sx) and power (B_dx) that must be minimized
- Fattore di merito S_sx/sqrt(B_sx)
- Signal purity: purity = (1-S_sx)*N_s / ( (1-S_sx)*N_s + B_dx*N_b )
Note: S_sx cdf_signal(0,x)
      B_dx cdf_background(inf, x)
      
Two cuts may be proposed: 
  - deltaR bbar_lepjj > 2.85
  - deltaR lep_jj < 0.9 

PS: the code of this folder are referred to an old version of the root files. 
    The angular variables are stored directly in the new trees
